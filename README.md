# mercure-anonymizer
DICOM anonymization module for mercure

| :--- |

## Installation

Install the module on your mercure server via the Modules page of the mercure web interface. Type in the following line into the Docker tag field. mercure will then automatically download and install the module, and it will automatically install updates when they get published on Docker Hub:
```
mercureimaging/mercure-anonymizer
```
Alternatively, you can clone this GitHub repository and build the Docker container locally on your server. It is recommended to append a distinct version tag (e.g., mercureimaging/mercure-anonymizer:dev) because otherwise the version will get replaced if a newer module version gets published on Docker Hub.

If you need to modify the source code, compile the code with Qt Creator for Qt version 5.12 under Ubuntu Linux 20.04 and copy the compiled binary file into the folder /bin. Afterwards, build the Docker container.

## Module Configuration

Settings for the anonymizer module can be defined either via the Module page (global module settings) or via the Rule page (rule-dependent processing settings). Both settings are merged prior to the processing, and rule-dependent settings will overrule global module settings if defined in both places.

Settings need to be entered in JSON format.

## General and Project-Specific Settings

General settings that are applied to all anonymization steps as well as project-specific settings can be defined. Project-specific settings are applied when a series (or study) has been sent to a certain Application Entity Title (AET). For example, if a series has been sent to mercure using the (receiver) AET "myproject", the "general" settings are applied and, in addition, the settings defined in the section "myproject" are applied (if settings are defined in both sections, project settings overrule the duplicate general settings).

The prefix "AZ_" can be added to the AET and will be ignored for the project assignment (i.e., both AETs "myproject" and "AZ_myproject" will be assigned to project "myproject"). This allows defining one global rule for all anonymization tasks by testing in the Selection Rule if "AZ_" is contained in the ReceiverAET (thus, 'AZ_' in @ReceiverAET@).

```
{
    "general": {
        ... define general settings here ...
    },
    "myproject": {
        ... define project specific settings here ...
    }
}
```

## Tag Assignment

You can specify how each DICOM tag should be processed during the anonymization by adding entries to the configurations section (either "general" or the project-specific section) with the following form:
```
Format:  "([group],[element])": "[command]"
Example: "(0010,1001)": "remove"
Example: "(0010,0010)": "set(@fake_name@)"
``` 
The following commands are available:

| Command     | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| keep        | Keep the tag value as is in the processed file |
| safe        | Mark the tag as known and safe, indicating that it does not contain PHI and is non-essential |
| remove      | Remove the tag completely from the file |
| clear       | Clear the tag value but keep the tag as empty value in the file |
| set(value)  | Set the tag to the value provided as parameter. Often used with helper macros listed below |
| truncdate   | Take the existing date value and change month and day to January 1st of the year |

Additional options exist that affect the processing of the tags. These options can be selected in the general section or in project-specific sections (note that values need to be provided as string, i.e. "true").

| Option              | Values       | Default | Description |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ------- | ----------- |
| remove_unknown_tags | true / false | true    | Removes all tags for which no assignment has been defined  |
| remove_safe_tags    | true / false | false   | Removes all tags that have been marked as "safe" (but not with "keep")  |
| remove_curves       | true / false | true    | Removes all tags associated with embedded curves (groups 5000-501E) |
| remove_overlays     | true / false | true    | Removes all tags associated with embedded overlays (groups 6000-601E) |
| print_assignment    | true / false | false   | Print the final tag assignment as log output ("general" section only) |

## Helper Macros



## Presets

To avoid having to provide extensive lists of tags assignments, the anonymizer provides presets for the tag assignment that can be selected in the general or project-specific sections. The preset initializes the tag assignment prior to evaluating the configuration sections. Individual tags can still be added or modified by writing tag-assignment entries into the general or project sections. Use the "print_assignment" option to review the assignment created by the different presets (see above).

Currently, the following presets exist. Please reach out to the authors if you think that the preset assignments are incomplete or if additional specific presets would be useful.

| Preset      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| default     | Restrictive removal of all tags known to contain PHI and removal of unknown (e.g., private) tags |
| none        | Empty assignment that keeps all tags as currently set |
